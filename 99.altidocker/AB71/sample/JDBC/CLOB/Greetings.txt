Since its foundation in 1999, Altibase Corp. has focused on providing ALTIBASE MMDBMS (Main Memory DBMS) solution that is optimized to meet various needs of customers and fast-changing IT environment, and consulting services. Altibase has built a solid customer base that includes leading companies in the telecommunications, finances and Internet fields of the country and it is widely recognized for the superiority of its product. It also has contributed to promoting the national image by exporting its product to overseas markets including China, Japan, Taiwan, Brazil, Ukraine and Indonesia.

It has implications from many aspects. First of all, Altibase is a venture company with eight years of business history, which has acted as the driving force in positioning MMDBMS. The MMDBMS is a new-concept product in the DBMS market where even large corporations had to suffer from fails due to high entry barriers and heavy reliance on foreign made DBMS. However, Altibase has established its reputation as a No. 1 company in the market, in tough competition with foreign providers. More than anything else, Altibase has proved that homegrown DBMS can also have limitless marketability if the company invests strenuous Research & Development efforts, speedy technological support, perfect quality control and timely response to user demands.

Altibase intends to continue its efforts to improve quality of its product by developing core technologies and making investments and, at the same time, it will plunge itself into the productive competition with global competitors by penetrating into the commercial DBMS market with Hybrid MM DBMS. Therefore, we hope that you will be always there to give us good attention and encouragement so that we can grow as a global DBMS company to rank with other global competitors.

Thank you.
