Installing Raspbian (stretch), Exagear V2.3, and the Latest Winsdr/Winquake on Raspberry Pi-3

11/6/2017

 

Save ALL current winsdr.ini files (16) before beginning!
Remove any USB flash drives or USB devices.
Install latest Raspbian (Stretch) on 16GB micro SD card or larger.
 

Download full Raspbian Stretch and extract.

Download and install WinDiskimager.

Burn micro SD card.

 

Setup to view hidden files from "view" in any folder.
Setup network.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
$ sync
$ sudo apt-get clean
$ sudo rpi-update
Setup keyboard, time zone, wifi country, and local, in Rpi-Preferences/Localization tab, disable splash screen in System tab.
Also in the System tab, you may need to disable underscan to fill the screen.
At this point you can rename the host system e.g. seismopi.
$ sudo reboot
 

Move the following into ~/Downloads:

 

exagear-desktop-rpi-3.tar.gzßget the latest version available, now v2.3

pk-000000002335.key (your exagear key file)

winsdr478b6_32bit.exe

wq339_32bit.exe

all winsdr.ini files (get them all, 16 if you save period extended channels), for each instance of winsdr you will be running and put them in separate directories, e.g. sys1ini and sys2ini.)

 

$ cd ~/Downloads
$ tar -xvzpf exagear-desktop-*.tar.gz
$ sudo ./install-exagear.sh
$ sync
$ sudo reboot
 

 

 

 

 

Test exagear:

 

Note: Once Exagear is installed, it is locked to the micro SD card and Rpi-3. To unlock use “purge” as explained in the exagear use guide pdf in ~/Downloads. If you can’t purge due to an unrecoverable crash, Eltechs will reset it for you when you send them your key file and a short note. (support@eltechs.com)

 

$ exagear
$ archßreturns "i686"
$ exit
$ archßreturns "armv7L"
$ sudo apt-get update ß as suggested by Eltech
 
Install wine in x86 environment: (takes awhile)

 

$ exagear
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install wine
Keep original /etc/pulse/client.conf (Default=N).
saned.service load error (Invalid argument)ßscanner issue, ignore for now
$ exit
$ sudo reboot
$ exagear
$ wine –versionßreturns "wine-2.0-eltechs"
 

At this point I see a 90 second delay when the Pi is shutdown, but other than being a PITA, installation continues OK. The following may help to resolve this issue:

 

“Enable persistence for the Systemd journal. The journal is by default non-persistent and so your systemd log-messages get thrown away at reboot.

To enable persistence:

$ sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
$ sudo chown root.systemd-journal /var/log/journal
$ sudo chmod g+rwx /var/log/journal
If you reboot the machine now, you can look at the logs for the last shutdown period and check for 90 second time gaps. Use this command:”

journalctl -b -1ßnumber
 

 

 

 

Install winsdr and winquake:

 

$ exagear
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ wine winsdr478b6_32bit.exe
Choose not to install "mono"(open source .net) and "Gecko"(open source web browser engine).
Create desktop icon for only the first instance of winsdr.
$ wine wq339_32bit.exe
Create desktop icon.
WinSDR and Winquake are now installed, remove winsdr.lnk and winquake .lnk files.
Run each instance of winsdr. Then populate all the ini files you saved in step 1 into ~/.wine/drive_c/WinSDR1, ~/.wine/drive_c/WinSDR2…
 

Install x11vnc:

 

$ sudo apt-get install x11vnc
$ x11vnc –storepasswdßprompt to add password
$ sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
Add to last line of autostart:
 

@x11vnc -forever -usepw -display :0 –ultrafilexfer

 

Add the following to /boot/congif.txt to allow full screen in x11vnc, without monitor:

1.      uncomment: hdmi_force_hotplug=1

2.      add: hdmi_group=2

3.      add: hdmi_mode=82

 

Add one high capacity USB drive to pi-3, visible by winsdr (a 256 GB drive works fine)

 

$ sudo apt-get install gparted (install the GUI partition editor, it will be useful)
Insert usb drive into pi
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
 

d-delete existing partition

n-new partition

p-primary partition

choose default sector sizes

1-partition number

no need to keep original type signature

w-write

 

$ sudo reboot
$ sudo fdisk -l  (check /dev/sda1 was created)
$ sudo umount /dev/sda1
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add following line to end of fstab:
 

/dev/sda1 /home/pi/seismodata ext4 defaults 0 2

 

$ sudo reboot
$ cd  ~/
$ sudo chmod 777 ./seismodata (make directory seismodata read/writable by everybody)
 

Link Linux USB devices to multiple com ports:

 

The kernel usually just assigns unpredictable device names, e.g. ttyUSBn, based on the order of discovery. To keep devices with fixed names do the following:
Create a file: $sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/49-usb-serial.rules
Add the following lines: (these are for my WebTronics16 bit PSN-ADC-USB V3 digitizers)
 

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403"

ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="AE01E315"

SYMLINK+="ttyUSB5"

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403"

ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="A6024YR0"

SYMLINK+="ttyUSB6"

 

ttyUSB5 and ttyUSB6 are linked to /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1. I had trouble using ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1, so I picked 5 and 6.
Specific {serial}, {idProduct} and {idVendor} can be found from                         $ lsusb -v and from reading $ dmesg.
Insert USB cable from digitizer(s).
Create soft links from Linux devices to com ports:
$ ln -s /dev/ttyUSB5 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com5
$ ln -s /dev/ttyUSB6 ~/.wine/dosdevices/com6
Now select the appropiate com port in winsdr Settings/System/General for each instance of winsdr.
 

 "GIF File Upload Settings":

 

"FTP Upload Settings" are for Events only, no need to enable FTP.
Set c:\winsdr directory permissions to everyone/everyone/everyone.
IP Address: 45.40.165.6ßyour hosting IP
username: earthmodeßyour username
Password: _______________ßyour password
check Passive Mode box
Set remote directories to whatever they may be, e.g. /sys1/, /sys2/.
 

Create Desktop Icons:

 

Create empty file on desktop e.g. WinSDR1.desktop with text editor.
Add:
 

      [Desktop Entry]

      Name=WinSDR1

      Exec=env WINEPREFIX="/home/pi/.wine" wine c:\\\\WinSDR1\\\\winsdr.exe

      Type=Application

      StartupNotify=true

      Path=/home/pi/.wine/dosdevices/c:/WinSDR1

      Icon=BDDF_winsdr.0ßmay have  different name

 

Save
