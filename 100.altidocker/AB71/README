If it is desired to use Altibase in shared memory mode, the value of 'shmall' must be set. This value determines the maximum size of an Altibase database.

These values must be set in order for Altibase to operate properly.
They must be set such that they are suitable for the system configuration.

2. Provide a license.
    Please rename and locate the license file as shown below.
    /home/niceguy/AB71/DB0/conf/license

    If no license file has been issued or if the license file has expired,
    Altibase services will not start.
    In this case, please visit http://support.altibase.com


3. Configure user environment variables 
    (using the user account with which Altibase was installed).
    Run the '/home/niceguy/AB71/DB0/install/post_install.sh' file
    under the account with which Altibase was installed.

    This script performs necessary post-installation configuration.

    1) Create the Altibase user environment file and apply it to the user profile.
         (/home/niceguy/AB71/DB0/conf/altibase_user.env)
    2) Create a database.

         If you selected 'YES' in response to the question about whether to create 
         a database after installation, at "Altibase Property setting step 1", 
         a database will be automatically created.

         If you selected 'NO' in response to this question,
         you need to create a database manually.

         shell> server create [DB Character Set] [National Character Set]


4. Start up and shut down the server
    shell> server start
    shell> server stop

5. Runs all scripts required for or used with PSM
    Run the '/home/niceguy/AB71/DB0/packages/catproc.sql' file.
